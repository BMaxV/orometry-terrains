# Sample results

This folder contains six terrains generated from the orometry of different regions and include the erosion of the DEM.
For each terrain, three files are provided:

* **TXT**: synthesized divide tree, output from the synthesis algorithm.
* **CSV**: peaks and orometrics of the synthesized terrain, as output by the synthesis algorithm.
* **PNG**: 24 bit normalized elevation map as RGB (red is higher). You should rescale it to the range shown in the table below.
